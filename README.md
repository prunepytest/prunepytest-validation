prunepytest validation suite
============================

This repo is intended to serve two purposes:

 - an extended validation suite, running [`prunepytest`](https://github.com/prunepytest/prunepytest)
   pre-test validator and test-time validators on a number of open source projects, to robustly increase
   code coverage, and catch regressions.
 - a showcase of how easy it is to integrate `prunepytest` into existing projects, and how to
   deal with some of the corner cases that pop up in practice
